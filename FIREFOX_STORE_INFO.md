### Support & FAQ

**Q: Will my pinned tabs be closed?**
A: No! Pinned tabs can be excluded completely or "discarded" (unloaded from memory but stay visible).

**Q: Do timestamps persist across browser restarts?**
A: Yes! The extension remembers when you last used each tab, even after restarting Firefox.

**Q: What's the difference between closing and discarding?**
A: Closing removes the tab completely. Discarding unloads it from memory but keeps it visible - perfect for pinned tabs!

**Q: Does this work with private browsing?**
A: The extension works in private windows but timestamps are not shared between regular and private sessions.

**Q: How much memory does this save?**
A: Depends on your tabs, but discarding can free 50-200MB per tab while keeping them accessible.
